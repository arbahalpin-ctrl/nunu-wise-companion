## Part 1: Monetization Model

### Recommended: Freemium + Subscription

#### Free Tier (Forever Free)
- ✅ Full access to Foods database (100+ items)
- ✅ Full access to Recipes (25+)
- ✅ Milestones tracker
- ✅ Mood check-in & calendar
- ✅ Sleep tracking (log naps, wake windows)
- ✅ **5 AI chat messages per day**
- ✅ Daily tips

#### Premium Tier - "Nunu+" (£4.99/month or £39.99/year)
- ✅ Everything in Free
- ✅ **Unlimited AI chat**
- ✅ Personalized sleep schedules
- ✅ Sleep training plans (step-by-step guides based on chosen method)

### Why This Model?
- Free tier builds user base and word-of-mouth
- 5 messages/day is enough to see value, not enough when you're desperate at 3am
- £4.99/month is impulse-purchase territory (less than a coffee)
- Annual discount (£39.99 = 33% off) encourages commitment

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Month | Users | Paid (5%) | MRR |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | 500 | 25 | £125 |
| 3 | 2,000 | 100 | £500 |
| 6 | 10,000 | 500 | £2,500 |
| 12 | 30,000 | 1,500 | £7,500 |

*MRR = Monthly Recurring Revenue*

## Part 3: Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1-2)
*Goal: Get 100 real users, fix bugs, collect feedback*

**Actions:**
1. Post in 3-5 Facebook mum groups you're personally in (not spammy, genuine)
   - "I built this app because I was struggling with [X], would love feedback"
2. Share with friends/family who are mums
3. Post on Mumsnet (genuinely helpful post, not ad)
4. Reply to sleep/weaning questions on Reddit r/beyondthebump, r/NewParents with helpful advice + soft mention

**Goal:** 100 users, 20+ feedback responses, fix any critical bugs

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Week 3-4)
*Goal: Generate buzz, get first paying customers*

**Actions:**
1. **ProductHunt launch** - Good for initial visibility, tech-savvy parents
2. **Press outreach** - Email 10 parenting bloggers/journalists
   - Subject: "Mum builds AI app after 4am desperation"
   - Personal story angle works better than feature list
3. **Instagram launch post** - Before/after of your own parenting journey
4. **TikTok video** - Raw, authentic, not polished
   - "I was so tired I built an app to help me survive"

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 2-6)
*Goal: Sustainable user acquisition*

**Channels (ranked by likely ROI):**

#### 1. Mum Facebook Groups (FREE, HIGH IMPACT)
- Don't spam. Be genuinely helpful.
- Answer questions, mention app naturally
- "I actually built an app for this exact problem..."
- Key groups: The Motherload, Breastfeeding Support UK, Gentle Sleep Training Support

#### 2. TikTok/Instagram Reels (FREE, HIGH POTENTIAL)
- Short, raw, relatable content
- "Day 47 of no sleep" type content
- Show the app naturally, don't hard sell
- Aim for 3 posts/week

#### 3. Mum Influencers (£50-500 per post)
- Micro-influencers (5k-50k followers) have better engagement
- Look for: tired mums, honest mums, not perfect Instagram mums
- Offer free premium + small fee for honest review
- Target 5 influencers in month 2-3

#### 4. SEO/Content (FREE, SLOW BUT LASTING)
- Write blog posts: "Best wake windows by age", "When to start weaning"
- These rank on Google and bring traffic for years
- Add to nunu-app.com/blog

#### 5. Referral Program (Month 3+)
- "Give a friend 1 month free, get 1 month free"
- Mums share with other mums naturally

#### 6. NHS/Health Visitor Partnership (Month 6+)
- Long shot but huge if it works
- Reach out to local NHS trust about pilot program
- "Free app to support new mothers' mental health"
