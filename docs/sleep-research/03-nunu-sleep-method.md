# The Nunu Sleep Method

*A Balanced, Evidence-Based Approach to Baby Sleep*
*Gentle-First, Judgment-Free*

## Our Philosophy

The Nunu Sleep Method is built on these core principles:

1. **No judgment** - Every family is different, and there's no single "right" way
2. **Evidence-based** - Our guidance is rooted in scientific research
3. **Flexibility** - We meet families where they are
4. **Gentle-first** - We start with gentle approaches, with options for all comfort levels
5. **Whole-family wellness** - Parent wellbeing matters for baby wellbeing

## The Nunu Framework: S.L.E.E.P.

### S - Set the Stage
**Create optimal conditions for sleep success**

### L - Learn Your Baby
**Understand cues, temperament, and developmental stage**

### E - Establish Routines
**Predictable patterns signal sleep time**

### E - Empower Independence (when ready)
**Gradually build self-soothing skills**

### P - Practice Patience
**Sleep is developmental - progress isn't linear**

## Age-Specific Guidance

### 🌙 Phase 1: The Fourth Trimester (0-3 months)

**What to expect:**
- Sleep is irregular and unpredictable - THIS IS NORMAL
- Baby cannot be "spoiled" at this age
- Night waking every 2-3 hours is biologically necessary
- No circadian rhythm yet

**Focus areas:**

**S - Set the Stage:**
- Safe sleep space (firm, flat, clear of objects)
- Room-share (not bed-share)
- Room temperature 16-20°C / 60-68°F
- White noise (65-70dB) mimics womb
- Darkness for night sleep

**L - Learn Your Baby:**
- Watch for early tired cues (zoning out, looking away)
- Notice individual patterns (some babies nap well in carriers, others need stillness)
- Track feeds and sleep loosely (not obsessively)

**E - Establish Routines:**
- Differentiate day and night:
  - Day: bright, social, normal household noise
  - Night: dim, quiet, minimal interaction
- Simple wind-down routine (5-10 min):
  - Diaper change
  - Swaddle
  - Feed (if needed)
  - Gentle rocking/holding
  - Lay down

**E - Empower Independence:**
- Not the focus yet!
- HOWEVER, you can occasionally practice putting baby down drowsy
- If it doesn't work, that's FINE - try again another time
- No formal sleep training at this age

**P - Practice Patience:**
- Survival mode is valid
- Do what you need to do
- This phase is temporary

**Sample newborn schedule:**
- Flexible 2-3 hour cycles
- Wake windows: 45-75 minutes
- Naps: variable, often short (30-45 min normal)
- Night: frequent waking normal

---

### 🌙 Phase 2: Emerging Patterns (3-6 months)

**What to expect:**
- Circadian rhythm developing
- Some babies start longer night stretches
- 4-month sleep "regression" (actually a progression)
- More predictable patterns emerge

**The 4-Month Sleep Shift:**
This is NOT a setback! Baby's sleep is MATURING:
- Sleep cycles now have 4 stages (like adults)
- Baby wakes more at cycle transitions
- This is the time to help with independent sleep IF desired

**S - Set the Stage:**
- Consistent sleep environment
- Dark room for all sleep
- Appropriate sleepwear (no loose blankets)
- Transition from swaddle (when rolling begins)

**L - Learn Your Baby:**
- Wake windows: 1.5-2.5 hours
- Tired cues: yawning, eye rubbing, fussiness
- Overtired signs: arching back, inconsolable

**E - Establish Routines:**
- More structured bedtime routine (15-20 min):
  - Bath (optional, not daily)
  - Massage
  - Pajamas
  - Feed
  - Story/song
  - Quiet cuddles
  - Into crib
- Consistent bedtime (within 30-min window)

**E - Empower Independence:**
*If you choose to work on independent sleep:*

**Gentle Options (Start Here):**

1. **Drowsy But Awake:** Put baby down progressively more awake each night
   
2. **Pick Up/Put Down:** Pick up when crying, soothe, put down when calm

3. **Shush-Pat:** Pat baby rhythmically while shushing; reduce gradually

4. **Pause Before Responding:** When baby stirs, wait 1-2 minutes before intervening

**More Structured Options (If Gentle Isn't Working):**

5. **Chair Method:** Sit next to crib, gradually move further away

6. **Timed Check-ins (Ferber):** Leave room, return at intervals (3-5-10 min)

**P - Practice Patience:**
- Progress may be slow
- Setbacks happen (illness, travel, teeth)
- Consistent implementation is key

**Sample 4-6 month schedule:**
- 3 naps (may vary)
- Wake windows: 1.5-2.5 hours
- Bedtime: 6:30-8:00 PM
- Night feeds: 1-2 typically still needed

---

### 🌙 Phase 3: Building Skills (6-12 months)

**What to expect:**
- Most babies CAN sleep 10-12 hours at night
- Many still wake (and that's okay too!)
- Nap transitions (3→2 naps around 7-9 months)
- Separation anxiety may emerge

**S - Set the Stage:**
- Consistent, dark sleep space
- Comfort object introduction (after 12 months safest; supervised earlier)
- White noise
- Optimal room temperature

**L - Learn Your Baby:**
- Wake windows: 2-4 hours (increasing with age)
- Notice developmental leaps affecting sleep
- 8-10 month regression common (object permanence + mobility)

**E - Establish Routines:**
- Solid bedtime routine (15-30 min)
- Consistent nap times
- Pre-nap wind-down (shorter than bedtime)

**E - Empower Independence:**

**If you haven't sleep trained and want to:**
This is often considered the "optimal" window:
- Baby is developmentally ready
- Night feeds often not necessary (check with pediatrician)
- Haven't developed strong contrary habits yet

**Choose your approach based on your comfort:**

| Comfort with Crying | Recommended Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Very uncomfortable | Chair method, PUPD, No-cry |
| Some okay | Ferber/graduated extinction |
| Okay if it's faster | Full extinction |

**Night Weaning (if ready):**
- Discuss with pediatrician
- Gradual reduction: decrease feed duration/amount
- OR pick a cutoff time (no feeds before X time)
- Partner can offer comfort instead of nursing parent

**P - Practice Patience:**
- 8-9 month regression is real
- Separation anxiety peaks around 9 months
- Keep routines consistent through disruptions

**Sample 6-9 month schedule:**
- 2-3 naps (transition to 2 around 7-9 months)
- Wake windows: 2-3 hours
- Bedtime: 6:30-7:30 PM
- Night feeds: 0-1 (most can physiologically drop)

**Sample 9-12 month schedule:**
- 2 naps
- Wake windows: 3-4 hours
- Bedtime: 6:30-7:30 PM
- Night feeds: 0 (typically)

---

### 🌙 Phase 4: Toddler Sleep (12-24 months)

**What to expect:**
- 2→1 nap transition (typically 14-18 months)
- 12 and 18-month regressions
- Testing boundaries!
- Language explosion affects sleep

**S - Set the Stage:**
- Safe sleep space
- Consider toddler-proofing room if transitioning to bed
- Lovey/comfort object fully allowed
- Night light if needed (very dim, warm color)

**L - Learn Your Baby:**
- Wake windows: 4-6 hours
- Watch for nap transition signs:
  - Fighting second nap
  - Bedtime battles
  - Early morning waking
- Transition takes 4-6 weeks typically

**E - Establish Routines:**
- Extended bedtime routine for connection (20-30 min)
- May include:
  - Bath
  - Teeth brushing
  - Pajamas
  - 2-3 books
  - Songs
  - Cuddles
  - Specific good-night ritual
- Visual schedules helpful

**E - Empower Independence:**
- Clear expectations and boundaries
- Choices within limits ("Do you want the blue or red pajamas?")
- Consistent response to curtain calls
- OK-to-wake clocks helpful 18+ months

**P - Practice Patience:**
- Toddlers test EVERYTHING
- Consistency is your best friend
- Regressions happen with development

**Nap transition tips:**
1. Push morning wake window gradually (add 15-30 min every few days)
2. Aim for ONE midday nap (12:00-2:30 PM typical range)
3. Move bedtime earlier during transition
4. Expect rocky weeks - that's normal
5. Once on 1 nap, wake windows: 5-6 hours AM, 4-5 hours PM

**Sample 12-18 month schedule (2 naps):**
- Wake: 6:30-7:00 AM
- Nap 1: 9:30-10:30 AM
- Nap 2: 2:00-3:30 PM
- Bedtime: 7:00-7:30 PM

**Sample 18-24 month schedule (1 nap):**
- Wake: 6:30-7:00 AM
- Nap: 12:00/12:30-2:00/2:30 PM
- Bedtime: 7:00-7:30 PM

## Sleep Training Decision Tree

```
Is baby 4+ months old?
├── NO → Focus on routines, not training
└── YES → 
    │
    Is there a medical issue? (reflux, allergies, apnea)
    ├── YES → Address medical issue first
    └── NO →
        │
        Are YOU ready for sleep training?
        ├── NO → That's okay! Continue responsive parenting
        └── YES →
            │
            How do you feel about crying?
            ├── Not comfortable → Try gentle methods first
            │   (Chair, PUPD, No-cry, Gradual changes)
            ├── Some is okay → Try Ferber/graduated
            └── Want fastest results → Full extinction
                │
                Is your partner on board?
                ├── NO → Get on same page first
                └── YES → Pick a method and STAY CONSISTENT
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Early Morning Waking (Before 6 AM)

**Possible causes:**
- Overtired at bedtime (try earlier bedtime)
- Undertired (last wake window too short)
- Light exposure (blackout curtains)
- Hunger (add dreamfeed or snack before bed)
- Habit (biological clock set too early)

**Solutions:**
- Treat anything before 6 AM as night
- Keep room dark
- Don't start day until target wake time
- Adjust bedtime/naps

### Short Naps (< 45 minutes)

**Under 5 months:**
- Developmentally normal!
- One sleep cycle = 45 min
- Often improves naturally

**Over 5 months:**
**Possible causes:**
- Wake window too short/long
- Undertired
- Sleep environment issues
- Hungry
- Unable to connect cycles

**Solutions:**
- Adjust wake windows
- Ensure dark, cool room
- Try "crib hour" (leave baby in crib for full hour)
- Consider brief check to resettle

### Bedtime Battles

**Possible causes:**
- Overtired
- Undertired
- Anxiety/fear
- Testing boundaries
- Uncomfortable

**Solutions:**
- Adjust timing
- Calming routine
- Clear expectations
- Address fears calmly
- Check environment

### Night Wakings

**First, rule out:**
- Hunger (genuinely needs feed)
- Discomfort (diaper, temperature)
- Illness
- Developmental leap

**If habitual:**
- Apply same settling method you use at bedtime
- Be consistent
- Consider night weaning if age-appropriate

## What Nunu Believes

### We Believe...

✅ **All parents want the best for their babies**

✅ **There's no one "right" way to handle sleep**

✅ **Sleep training is a personal choice, not a requirement**

✅ **Evidence shows sleep training is safe when done appropriately**

✅ **Responsive parenting and sleep training can coexist**

✅ **Parental wellbeing matters - exhausted parents struggle to be their best**

✅ **Babies are individuals - what works for one may not work for another**

✅ **Some babies need more support than others - this is temperament, not failure**

✅ **Night waking is biologically normal, even if inconvenient**

✅ **Sleep is developmental - it WILL improve over time**

### We Don't Believe...

❌ Judging families for their choices

❌ One method is superior to all others

❌ Every baby needs formal sleep training

❌ Crying is inherently harmful (in controlled contexts)

❌ Responding to your baby spoils them

❌ Parents who sleep train are neglectful

❌ Parents who don't sleep train are martyrs

❌ There's a deadline by which babies "should" sleep through

## Final Words

Sleep is hard. Parenting is hard. You're doing an amazing job.

Whether you choose to actively sleep train or let things unfold naturally, know that:

1. **This phase will pass** - Even the worst sleepers eventually sleep
2. **You know your baby** - Trust your instincts
3. **Ask for help** - From partners, family, professionals
4. **Take care of yourself** - You can't pour from an empty cup
5. **Be kind to yourself** - Perfect parenting doesn't exist

Nunu is here to support you, whatever path you choose. 💜
