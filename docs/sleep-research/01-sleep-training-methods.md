## Overview

Sleep training refers to various methods that help babies learn to fall asleep independently and stay asleep through the night. The goal is teaching self-soothing skills so babies can settle themselves when they wake during normal sleep cycles.

**Important Note:** Sleep training is NOT the same as night weaning. Babies can still receive night feeds during sleep training.

## 1. Cry It Out (CIO) / Extinction Method

### What It Is
The full extinction method involves putting baby to bed drowsy but awake and not returning until morning (or the next scheduled feed), regardless of crying.

### How It Works - Step by Step
1. Establish a consistent bedtime routine (bath, feed, story, etc.)
2. Put baby in crib drowsy but awake
3. Say goodnight, leave the room, and close the door
4. Do not return until morning or scheduled feeding time
5. Baby eventually tires and falls asleep

### Appropriate Ages
- **Minimum:** 4-6 months
- **Optimal:** 6+ months
- Baby should be developmentally capable of sleeping through the night without feeds

### Pros
- ✅ Fastest method - often works within 3-4 nights
- ✅ Clear and simple to follow
- ✅ No ambiguity about what to do
- ✅ Research shows no long-term negative effects on child's emotions, behavior, or attachment

### Cons
- ❌ Emotionally very difficult for parents
- ❌ Extended crying can be distressing
- ❌ May not suit all temperaments
- ❌ Requires commitment and consistency

### Scientific Evidence
**Key Study:** Gradisar et al. (2016) - Pediatrics
- Randomized controlled trial comparing graduated extinction and bedtime fading
- Found no negative effects on infant stress (cortisol), child-parent attachment, or child behavioral problems at 12 months
- 5-year follow-up showed no adverse outcomes

**Additional Evidence:**
- A review of 52 sleep studies (published in Sleep journal) found extinction methods effective when applied consistently
- No evidence of long-term negative effects on mental health or parent-child attachment

### Common Criticisms
- Some attachment parenting advocates argue it may cause distress
- Critics cite concerns about cortisol levels (though research doesn't support long-term harm)
- May feel incompatible with responsive parenting philosophy

### Success Rate
- **Very High:** 80-90% when consistently applied
- Most babies sleep through the night within 3-7 nights

## 2. Ferber Method (Graduated Extinction)

### What It Is
Developed by Dr. Richard Ferber, this method allows parents to check on crying babies at gradually increasing intervals. Also called "check and console" or "controlled crying."

### How It Works - Step by Step

**Night 1:**
1. Complete bedtime routine
2. Put baby down drowsy but awake
3. Leave the room
4. If baby cries, wait 3 minutes before first check
5. Brief check (1-2 minutes max): pat, soothe verbally, but don't pick up
6. Leave again, wait 5 minutes before next check
7. Continue with 10 minute intervals until baby sleeps

**Progressive Schedule:**
| Day | 1st Wait | 2nd Wait | 3rd Wait | Subsequent |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| 1   | 3 min    | 5 min    | 10 min   | 10 min     |
| 2   | 5 min    | 10 min   | 12 min   | 12 min     |
| 3   | 10 min   | 12 min   | 15 min   | 15 min     |
| 4   | 12 min   | 15 min   | 17 min   | 17 min     |
| 5   | 15 min   | 17 min   | 20 min   | 20 min     |
| 6   | 17 min   | 20 min   | 25 min   | 25 min     |
| 7   | 20 min   | 25 min   | 30 min   | 30 min     |

### Appropriate Ages
- **Minimum:** 4 months (with pediatrician approval)
- **Optimal:** 6+ months
- Can be adapted for toddlers

### Pros
- ✅ More gradual than CIO - easier emotionally for some parents
- ✅ Provides reassurance to baby through check-ins
- ✅ Well-researched with strong evidence base
- ✅ Flexible - intervals can be adjusted
- ✅ Usually effective within 3-7 nights

### Cons
- ❌ Check-ins can sometimes escalate crying
- ❌ Still involves crying, which is difficult for parents
- ❌ Requires consistency and tracking of intervals
- ❌ Some babies become more upset when parent leaves again

### Scientific Evidence
**Key Studies:**
- Mindell et al. (2006) - American Academy of Sleep Medicine: Behavioral treatments including graduated extinction reliably improve infant sleep
- Hiscock et al. (2007): Sleep training improved infant sleep and reduced maternal depression at 2-month follow-up
- Price et al. (2012): 5-year follow-up showed no adverse effects on emotional/behavioral development or parent-child relationship

### Common Criticisms
- Some argue any crying is harmful (not supported by research)
- Check-ins can feel like "teasing" the baby
- May not work for very sensitive or high-needs babies

### Success Rate
- **High:** 70-85%
- Most families see significant improvement within one week

## 3. Chair Method / Sleep Lady Shuffle / Fading

### What It Is
A gradual approach where the parent slowly reduces their presence in the room over several nights/weeks. Also called "camping out."

### How It Works - Step by Step

**Week 1 (Days 1-3):**
1. Complete bedtime routine
2. Put baby in crib drowsy but awake
3. Sit in a chair right next to the crib
4. Offer minimal verbal and physical comfort (shushing, patting) without picking up
5. Stay until baby falls asleep

**Week 2 (Days 4-6):**
- Move chair halfway to the door
- Continue minimal comfort from new position

**Week 3 (Days 7-9):**
- Move chair to the doorway
- Continue minimal comfort

**Week 4 (Days 10-12):**
- Sit outside the room but within sight/earshot
- Gradually remove yourself completely

### Appropriate Ages
- **Minimum:** 6 months
- **Better for:** Older babies (9+ months) and toddlers
- Good for children with separation anxiety

### Pros
- ✅ Very gradual - less crying than extinction methods
- ✅ Parent presence provides comfort
- ✅ Good for parents uncomfortable with crying
- ✅ Can work well for anxious children

### Cons
- ❌ Takes longer (2-3 weeks typically)
- ❌ Some crying still occurs
- ❌ Your presence can be stimulating for some babies
- ❌ Requires patience and consistency over extended period
- ❌ Baby may be confused when they wake and you're not there

### Scientific Evidence
- Less formal research than extinction methods
- Gradisar et al. (2016) found bedtime fading effective with no adverse effects
- Clinical experience supports effectiveness for many families

### Common Criticisms
- Can prolong the process unnecessarily
- Parent presence may prevent baby from learning to self-soothe
- May be inconsistent if parent falls asleep or leaves

### Success Rate
- **Moderate to High:** 60-75%
- Success depends heavily on consistent implementation

## 4. Pick Up, Put Down (PUPD) Method

### What It Is
Attributed to Tracy Hogg ("The Baby Whisperer"), this method involves picking up baby when they cry, soothing them, then putting them back down repeatedly until they fall asleep.

### How It Works - Step by Step
1. Complete bedtime routine
2. Put baby in crib drowsy but awake
3. If baby cries, wait briefly to see if they settle (1-2 minutes)
4. If crying continues, pick baby up and soothe
5. As soon as baby calms, put them back down
6. Repeat as many times as needed until baby falls asleep
7. Key: Don't let baby fall asleep in your arms

### Appropriate Ages
- **Best for:** 4-8 months
- **Less effective for:** Older babies/toddlers (can become a game)
- Not recommended under 3 months

### Pros
- ✅ Very responsive to baby's needs
- ✅ Provides physical comfort
- ✅ No extended crying periods
- ✅ Feels gentle and nurturing

### Cons
- ❌ Can take a VERY long time (sometimes hours)
- ❌ Exhausting for parents
- ❌ May overstimulate some babies
- ❌ Can become a game for older babies
- ❌ Limited research on effectiveness

### Scientific Evidence
- Based on clinical experience rather than formal research
- Anecdotal support but lacks rigorous studies
- May work well for sensitive babies who need more reassurance

### Common Criticisms
- Very time-intensive
- May delay development of self-soothing
- Can be frustrating when repeated many times
- Success varies widely

### Success Rate
- **Variable:** 50-70%
- Highly dependent on baby's temperament and parent's consistency

## 5. No-Cry Solutions / Elizabeth Pantley Method

### What It Is
Based on Elizabeth Pantley's book "The No-Cry Sleep Solution," this approach focuses on gently changing sleep associations without leaving baby to cry.

### How It Works - Step by Step

**Phase 1: Observation (Week 1)**
1. Keep detailed sleep logs
2. Identify current sleep associations (nursing, rocking, etc.)
3. Note baby's natural sleep patterns

**Phase 2: Gradual Changes (Weeks 2-8+)**
1. Create a consistent, calming bedtime routine
2. Put baby down progressively more awake over time
3. Use "Pantley Pull-Off" - remove breast/bottle just before baby falls asleep, let them root and self-soothe
4. Gradually reduce sleep associations

**Phase 3: Consistency**
- Continue gentle removal of sleep associations
- Stay patient - progress is very gradual

### Appropriate Ages
- **Any age:** Newborns through toddlers
- **Especially suited for:** Parents philosophically opposed to any crying
- Good for breastfed babies

### Pros
- ✅ Minimal or no crying
- ✅ Respects attachment parenting philosophy
- ✅ Works with baby's natural rhythms
- ✅ Can be used from very early age
- ✅ Emphasizes routines and sleep environment

### Cons
- ❌ Very slow - can take weeks to months
- ❌ Requires extensive record-keeping
- ❌ Results may be incremental and hard to measure
- ❌ Less effective for persistent sleep problems
- ❌ Limited scientific research

### Scientific Evidence
- Based largely on anecdotal evidence and clinical experience
- No rigorous controlled trials
- Philosophy aligns with attachment theory principles

### Common Criticisms
- Too slow for exhausted parents
- May delay learning independent sleep
- Success is unpredictable
- Requires very high commitment

### Success Rate
- **Variable:** 40-60%
- Better for mild sleep issues than severe problems

## 6. EASY Routine (Tracy Hogg)

### What It Is
A structured routine that organizes baby's day into predictable cycles. Not strictly sleep training, but creates foundation for good sleep.

**E - Eat**
**A - Activity**
**S - Sleep**
**Y - Your time**

### How It Works - Step by Step

**For Newborns (0-3 months):**
- 3-hour EASY cycle
- Feed upon waking
- Short activity/awake time (45-60 min total including feed)
- Sleep (nap until next feed)
- Repeat throughout day

**For Older Babies (4-6 months):**
- 4-hour EASY cycle
- Feed upon waking
- Activity (1.5-2 hours including feed)
- Sleep
- Repeat

**Key Principles:**
1. Always feed AFTER sleep, not TO sleep
2. Watch for sleep cues during activity time
3. Put down drowsy but awake
4. Consistent routine for all sleeps

### Appropriate Ages
- **From birth** through toddlerhood
- Adapted as baby grows

### Pros
- ✅ Creates predictable routine
- ✅ Prevents feeding-to-sleep association
- ✅ Can start from very early age
- ✅ Helps parents understand baby's needs
- ✅ Builds foundation for good sleep habits

### Cons
- ❌ Rigid structure may not suit all families
- ❌ Doesn't directly address night wakings
- ❌ May feel too scheduled for some parents
- ❌ Hungry babies may need to eat before "scheduled" time

### Scientific Evidence
- No specific research on EASY routine
- Aligns with research supporting consistent routines
- Evidence that separating feeding from sleep onset helps sleep

### Common Criticisms
- Too rigid for some families
- May conflict with responsive feeding
- Not suitable for all baby temperaments

### Success Rate
- **Framework rather than training method**
- Creates conditions for sleep success

## 7. Wake Windows / Age-Appropriate Schedules

### What It Is
Understanding and respecting baby's natural biological windows of wakefulness to prevent over-tiredness.

### Wake Window Guidelines by Age

| Age | Wake Window | Typical Naps |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| 0-1 month | 30-60 min | 6+ naps |
| 1-2 months | 60-90 min | 5-6 naps |
| 2-3 months | 75-120 min | 4-5 naps |
| 3-4 months | 90-120 min | 4 naps |
| 4-6 months | 2-2.5 hours | 3 naps |
| 6-9 months | 2.5-3 hours | 2-3 naps |
| 9-12 months | 3-4 hours | 2 naps |
| 12-18 months | 3.5-5 hours | 1-2 naps |
| 18-24 months | 5-6 hours | 1 nap |

### Tired Cues to Watch For
**Early cues (catch these!):**
- Staring off/zoning out
- Less social/less smiling
- Slower movements
- Red eyebrows/brow

**Overtired cues (you've missed the window!):**
- Eye rubbing
- Yawning
- Fussiness/crying
- Arching back
- Pulling ears

### How to Use Wake Windows
1. Note when baby wakes
2. Start calming routine before wake window ends
3. Begin putting baby down at end of wake window
4. Adjust based on individual baby's cues

### Scientific Evidence
- Based on understanding of infant circadian rhythm development
- Research shows overtired babies have more difficulty falling and staying asleep
- NSF recommendations support age-appropriate sleep amounts

## Choosing the Right Method

### Decision Framework

**Consider CIO/Ferber if:**
- Baby is 6+ months
- Parents need faster results
- Baby is healthy with no medical issues
- Parents can be consistent
- Other methods have failed

**Consider Gentle Methods (Chair, PUPD, No-Cry) if:**
- Baby is younger (4-6 months)
- Parents strongly prefer no crying
- Baby has separation anxiety
- Family has time for gradual approach
- Philosophical opposition to crying

**Consider EASY/Wake Windows if:**
- Baby is very young (0-4 months)
- Creating foundation for future sleep
- Want structure without formal training
- Baby doesn't have severe sleep issues

### Important Considerations

1. **No "One Size Fits All"** - Different methods work for different families
2. **Consistency is Key** - Any method requires consistent application
3. **Timing Matters** - Don't start during illness, travel, or major transitions
4. **Partner Support** - Both caregivers should agree on approach
5. **Pediatrician Consultation** - Rule out medical issues first
6. **Trust Your Instincts** - You know your baby best
